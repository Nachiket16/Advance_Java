# JavaScript Hoisting for Beginners

## What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

## Key Points for Interviews

1. Hoisting applies to variable and function declarations, not initializations.
2. Only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments.
3. Function declarations are hoisted completely.
4. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
5. Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone).

## Examples

### 1. Variable Hoisting with `var`

```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 5

// The above code is interpreted as:
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```

### 2. Function Declaration Hoisting

```javascript
sayHello(); // Output: "Hello!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// This works because function declarations are fully hoisted
```

### 3. Function Expression Hoisting

```javascript
try {
  sayHi(); // Throws a TypeError
} catch(error) {
  console.log("Error:", error.message);
}

var sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};

// Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment
```

### 4. Let and Const Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;

// Similarly for const
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
const y = 10;
```

## Interview Tips

1. **Explain it simply**: "Hoisting is like moving declarations to the top of their scope."

2. **Var vs Let/Const**: Mention that `var` is initialized with `undefined`, while `let` and `const` are not initialized.

3. **Function Declarations vs Expressions**: Highlight that function declarations are fully hoisted, but function expressions are not.

4. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: For `let` and `const`, the period between entering scope and being declared is called the TDZ. Accessing the variable in TDZ throws a ReferenceError.

5. **Best Practice**: Recommend declaring variables at the top of their scope to avoid confusion.

6. **Real-World Impact**: Discuss how hoisting can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood properly.
